## Get Started
`npm install` or `yarn install`

`npm start` or `yarn start` to start the dev server.

## Adding components
Add your components to `src/index.js` and import them as such. Ideally, you'd want to follow the Atomic Design principle using atoms/molecules/organisms/templates/pages

In order for components to be imported, you add the name of the folder and webpack will bundle it.
